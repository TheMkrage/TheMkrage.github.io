title: Vex Scout 2.0
---
Today, I released version 2.0 of Vex Scout.  For those of you who do not know, Vex Scout is an iOS application that I created to simplify scouting.  It fetches the data from robotevents, and organizes it in a more simplified manner. It also calculates in-depth statistics for each team to give users a more detailed idea of what teams they will be competing against.
