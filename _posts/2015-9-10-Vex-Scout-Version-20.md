Today, I released version 2.0 of [Vex Scout](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vex-scout/id1012279776?mt=8).  For those of you who do not know, Vex Scout is an iOS application that I created to simplify Vex Robotics scouting.  It fetches the data from robotevents, and organizes it in a more simplified manner. It also calculates in-depth statistics for each team to give users a more detailed idea of what teams they will be competing against.

### Changes
In Version 2.0 of Vex Scout, I redid the entire User Interface. Before, the User Interface was simply text and buttons.  This was mainly because we rushed it onto the App Store in early June of 2015.  Since then, I have been working to program a User Interface that not only looks nicer, but also makes the app easier to navigate.

The View that probably is the most different is the main menu. The main menu now uses custom card views that each contains different information.  From the card views on the main menu, you can now see basic stats about &#34My Team&#34, some of your favorited or bookmarked teams, and the top robot skills and programming skills.  The main menu also now contains an all-in-one search bar. You can now search through teams and competitions from the main menu. &#34Settings&#34 and &#34More&#34 buttons are also placed on the top navigation bar.

The user interface on most of the other pages has also been redone. They are now more than just text. Take a look for yourself:

### New Features
Robot Skills and Programming Skills can now be seen on a teams profile.  This gives users a more accurate idea of how fast a team can score, or how well they are at programming.

OPR, DPR, and CCWM are all now supported and are shown on the newly added &#34Graphs&#34 pages.  This is another tab added when viewing a teams profile.

Users can now favorite teams andr competitions.  This allows for the creation of a pick list for elimination selections.

&#34More&#34 and &#34Settings&#34 have now been added.  &#34Settings&#34 allows you to change what team you are on (used for &#34My Team&#34) and to change what season you are viewing.  You can also change the season on any team’s profile page.  The &#34More&#34 page contains miscellaneous links to helpful information.
Inside of &#34More&#34, there is also a match predictor. From OPR, DPR, and CCWM, the app gives a percentage that a certain alliance will win.
