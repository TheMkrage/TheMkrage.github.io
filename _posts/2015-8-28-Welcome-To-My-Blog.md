title: Welcome to my Blog!
---

I will blog about anything pertaining to robotics, programming, and the advancement of technology.  Here is little about me.  I am currently a dedicated member to FIRST Robotics Team 3309 and VEX Robotics Team 3309B, the Friarbots.  I spend most of my time programming, but also contribute to the design process of the robots.  I joined my VEX Team in 2014, our rookie year.  Since no one had prior experience, there was an oppurtunity for me to be leader. I kept the team accountable and made sure we worked our hardest, and we ended up qualifying for world championships during our rookie year. The next year, I was elected president of the VEX Team. 
Aside from programming robots, I also have a passion for iOS Development.  I currently have one app on the app store, (Vex Scout)[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vex-scout/id1012279776?mt=8]. This app allows teams participating in the VEX Robotics Competition to scout other teams on the fly and receive in-depth statistics about their performance. I plan to post more apps soon.
Updates about my robotics and iOS developement experience will be posted when there is an event or a major product to be released. 
Aside from robotics and programming, I participate in Junior Statesmen of America, and Speech and Debate.  These two clubs have surely made me a better communicator. Regardless of what career I take on, this skill will prove to be valuable. In debate, I participate in Congressional Debate and Parliamentary Debate.  In JSA, I attend the conventions and speak on various topics of interest.  I always enjoy talking in debates relating to technology because that is my area of interest and I always feel sure and confident about my opinions. 
Updates on my Debate and JSA experience will be posted when major events occur.
I hope this blog proves to be interesting and that I can inspire others to take on similar interests. For more about me, (visit my website)[krager.org]
