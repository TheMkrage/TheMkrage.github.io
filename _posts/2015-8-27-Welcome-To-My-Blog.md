title: Welcome to my Blog!
---
The reason for this blog to record and share what I do in all aspects of my life. So you know what to expect, here is a little about myself:

I am a very well-rounded, diverse person.  I have my heart set on majoring in Computer Science in college, but I still have other interests.  Most of my extra-curricular activities and clubs can be divided into two groups.  One group consists of anything technologically related, whether it be engineering, robotics, or programming. The other group consists of anything pertaining to public speaking and communication, containing Debate and JSA.  I prioritize the first group over the latter, but I certainly am still involved in and enjoy public speaking.

## Robotics and Programming
I am currently a dedicated member to FIRST Robotics Team 3309 and VEX Robotics Team 3309B, the Friarbots.  I spend most of my time programming, but also contribute to the design process of the robots.  I joined my VEX Team in 2014, our rookie year.  Since no one had prior experience, there was an opportunity for me to be a leader. I kept the team accountable and made sure we worked our hardest, and we ended up qualifying for world championships during our rookie year. The next year, I was elected president of the VEX Team. 

Aside from programming robots, I also have a passion for iOS Development.  I currently have one app on the app store, [Vex Scout](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vex-scout/id1012279776?mt=8). This app allows teams participating in the VEX Robotics Competition to scout other teams on the fly and receive in-depth statistics about their performance. I plan to post more apps soon. Updates about my robotics and iOS development experiences will be posted when there is an event or a major product to be released. 

## Debate and Junior Statesmen of America
Aside from robotics and programming, I participate in Junior Statesmen of America, and Speech and Debate.  These two clubs have surely made me a better communicator. Regardless of what career I take on, this skill will prove to be valuable. In debate, I participate in Congressional Debate and Parliamentary Debate.  In JSA, I attend the conventions and speak on various topics of interest.  I always enjoy talking in debates relating to technology because that is my area of interest and I always feel sure and confident about my opinions. Updates on my Debate and JSA experience will be posted when major events occur.

I hope this blog proves to be interesting and that I can inspire others to take on similar interests. For more about me, [visit my website.](krager.org)
